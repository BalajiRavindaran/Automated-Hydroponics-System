## Automated-Hydroponics-System

<ul>
  <li>Designed and developed an automated indoor hydroponics system to maintain optimal growing conditions for plants using sensors and embedded control.</li>
  <li>Built the system using Arduino MEGA 2560 as the central controller, interfaced with a 4x4 keypad, 16x2 LCD display, DHT11 (temperature & humidity), pH sensor, water level sensor, grow lights, submersible pump, and a custom humidifier.</li>
  <li>Created a fully functional control system allowing operation in three modes: Automatic, Manual, and Economy, selected via the keypad interface.</li>
  <li>Implemented automatic pH balancing by integrating mineral reservoirs that dispense nutrients based on sensor feedback.</li>
  <li>Used an all-spectrum grow light and fluorescent lighting system to simulate ideal plant growth conditions indoors.</li>
  <li>Incorporated a water circulation system with a 40W submersible pump, large water reservoir, and angled PVC piping to enable smooth water flow and nutrient delivery.</li>
  <li>Designed and fabricated a powder-coated aluminum frame with a compact footprint for indoor usability and aesthetic appeal.</li>
  <li>Developed a humidifier module to maintain consistent humidity levels essential for healthy plant growth.</li>
  <li>System can be scaled or modified for use with various hydroponics-compatible plants with appropriate nutrient supplementation.</li>
